# Differences in types of Conversational Interfaces 

There are 3 main types of Conversational Interfaces. 
Depending on the most appropriate for your users, we can establish some very clear differences and elements in common between them.

**Voice applications** 

They let you complete your task and control your device with spoken commands. In return you'll get audible responses from the application. 

These are the elements of a voice-only interface: 

- Voice commands 
- Audible response from assistant 
- Audible list of options 
- Descriptive options for users
- Sometimes a button is present to help start or end conversation 

**Text applications**

Also known as chat applications, they allow the user to complete their task and interact with the interface by sending and receiving messages.

These are the elements of a text-only interface: 

- Text Commands
- Written response from assistant with sound 
- Written list of options
- Video or Images to help the users make a choice
- Button available to make certain selections easier

**Multimodal applications**

They allow the user to interact with the interface by combining different features from voice and text, taking advantage of the strengths of each. 

These are the elements of a multimodal interface: 

- Voice or Text Commands
- Written or audible response from assistant
- Audible or written list of options 
- Video or Images to help the users make a choice
- Button available to make certain selections easier
