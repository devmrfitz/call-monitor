## Preparing the environment

Rox AI ships as a Docker container, open a file named `docker-compose.yml` and paste the content of this YAML.

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  rox:
    image: fonoster/rox:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      LOGS_LEVEL: verbose

  ngrok:
    image: wernight/ngrok:latest
    ports:
      - 4040:4040
    environment:
      NGROK_PROTOCOL: http
      NGROK_PORT: rox:3000
```

## Running the Connector

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Connecting your Voice Application to Fonoster

Look for the newly generated [Ngrok's URL](http://localhost:4040/inspect/http), and update the Number webhook URL on **SIP NETWORK** of your previously created Fonoster Voice App.
